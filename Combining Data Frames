Types of files and reads associated with it

Tools for Pandas data Import
pd.read_csv() # for csv files
pd.read_excel()
pd.read_htmt()
pd.read_json()

load separate files
 1. loading each file at a time is time taking
 2. uses multiple pd.read_csv at a time
  traditional and novice to this
  
Load using a loop

define files in a list
filenames = ['first.csv', 'second.csv', .... 'n.csv']
intialize a variable known a dataframe
dataframe = []
for f in filenames
    dataframes.append(pd.read_csv(f))
    -- this method help to load a files defined in filenames - type list

Using a list comprehension

filesnames = ['first.csv', 'second.csv', .... 'n.csv']
dataframes = [pd.read_csv(f) for f in filenames]

Using glob
from glob import glob
filenames = glob('sales*.csv') - define all the files that needs to be read or processed , * will act as wild card.
dataframes = [pd.read_csv(f) for f in filenames]

Combining DataFrames from multiple data files
In this exercise, you'll combine the three DataFrames from earlier exercises - gold, silver, & bronze - into a single DataFrame called medals. The approach you'll use here is clumsy. Later on in the course, you'll see various powerful methods that are frequently used in practice for concatenating or merging DataFrames.

Remember, the column labels of each DataFrame are NOC, Country, and Total, where NOC is a three-letter code for the name of the country and Total is the number of medals of that type won.
